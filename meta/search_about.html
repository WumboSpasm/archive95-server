                        Archive95 is an unorthodox web archive which derives its collection
                        from obscure sources such as "offline internet" CD-ROMs, with the
                        goal of making the data accessible through a user-friendly interface.
                        Much of the collection predates the Internet Archive's formation in
                        May 1996.

                        As quality control varies wildly between the sources represented in
                        the archive, considerable effort has been put into presenting each page
                        as authentically as possible. However, it is not perfect, and you will
                        occasionally find broken outlinks or files with an unknown URL.
                        <div class="about-break"></div>
                        The following sources are represented...
                        <ul>
{SOURCES}
                        </ul>
                        ...for a grand total of <b>{TOTAL}</b> URL archives (excluding orphan files).
                        <div class="about-break"></div>
                        Some pages also have screenshots of themselves as they appeared in
                        1995, courtesy of World Wide Web Directory. They are accessible
                        through the navigation bar, and may be useful if the actual page
                        archive is missing images.
