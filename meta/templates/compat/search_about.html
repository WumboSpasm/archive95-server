		<h2>About this website</h2>
		<p>Archive95 is an independent web archive with the goal of preserving early web content that predates or has otherwise gone under the radar of more mainstream web archives. This is achieved by leveraging a bygone genre of CD-ROMs that provided offline approximations of the internet for those who weren't yet connected, and now serve as valuable time capsules of what the web once was.</p>
		<p>Typically the preserved data will be altered in some way, such as to redirect web-bound links to offline equivalents. Sometimes the URLs from which the data was sourced are not adequately attributed. This necessitates a comprehensive restoration process that, while largely effective, is not perfect, so you may occasionally find unavailable links or files with an unknown URL.</p>
		<p>Some pages also have screenshots of themselves as they appeared in 1995, sourced from World Wide Web Directory. They are accessible through the navigation bar, and may help form an idea of a page's intended appearance if the archived version is missing images.</p>
